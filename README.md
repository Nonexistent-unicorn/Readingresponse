Most people want or expect videogames to be fun and lighthearted, but that isn’t what a video game is about to me.
A good video game embodies hardships and makes you feel emotions, just like any other form of art or media should.
A game where you embody a weak character fills these roles well because you can really get into the character and feel what they feel at high tension moments.
The last of us games were amazing because you got to experience the emotions and hardships that the characters went through in an almost cinematic way.
Even though the characters had growth, they were still weak and had to work hard to avoid the infected and the bad guys.
Even though these games don’t depict real events, it still puts the player in the shoes of various people with a wide range of emotions and weaknesses, depicting an accurate representation of human behavior. 
It makes you empathize with opposing characters and makes you connect to side characters to the point where you are crying with your character when a side character dies or is badly injured. 
It created loss, hope, anxiety, melancholy, and a wide range of other emotions while still being an enjoyable game. 
I think a lot of games are made to be fun, but a game doesn’t have to be fun to be considered a game. A lot of different forms of expression are used to address political issues. 
For instance, a lot of music, cinema and literature is used to address gun violence, domestic abuse/sexual abuse, drugs, etc. 
Just like these, games can address issues as well, and could potentially create an even deeper connection between the player and the topic it portrays by putting the player in the shoes of the characters. 
I don’t think any genre of expression can be considered purely for fun.
